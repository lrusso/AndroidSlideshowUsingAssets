Android Slideshow using Assets

How to use it? The Gallery.java is an Activity (check it out) and it gets all the images sorted from the assets folder.

## IMPORTANT

This are a few examples of file images in the assets folder:

- /assets/image001 - House.png
- /assets/image002 - Bed.png
- /assets/image003 - Dog.png

The images will show in order and the description will be everything after ' - '. Only use png files.
